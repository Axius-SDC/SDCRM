## **Abstract**

The Semantic Data Charter (SDC) is a framework for creating semantically rich, machine-readable, and interoperable data models. It provides a set of principles and a reference model for defining data with clear, unambiguous meaning, ensuring that data is not only structured but also self-describing. This specification details the SDC Reference Model (RM), the core data types, and provides guidance on creating domain-specific data models.

## **1\. Introduction**

In an increasingly data-driven world, the ability to share, understand, and reuse data across different systems and domains is paramount. Traditional data modeling approaches often focus on data structure, leaving meaning implicit and open to misinterpretation. The Semantic Data Charter addresses this challenge by providing a framework for creating data models that are both structurally sound and semantically explicit.  
The SDC is founded on three core pillars:

* **Enforce Governance:** Establish a formal, machine-readable contract for your data.  
* **Embed Meaning:** Link your data to a universal business vocabulary.  
* **Mandate Quality:** Formally define rules for handling imperfect data.

This specification provides the technical details of the SDC Reference Model, which is implemented in XML Schema (XSD) and OWL (Web Ontology Language).

## 

## **2\. Standards Compliance and Enabling**

SDC4 is built upon and leverages established open standards from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure broad interoperability, machine readability, and semantic richness. It is designed not to replace existing domain-specific standards but to provide a foundational, unifying layer that enhances their capabilities, particularly in areas of data governance, semantic grounding, and data quality.

### **2.1. Foundational W3C Standards**

SDC4 directly utilizes and aligns with the following core W3C standards:

* **XML Schema (XSD):** The structural backbone of SDC4. All SDC Reference Models and derived Data Models are defined using XSD, providing a robust, widely understood mechanism for defining data structures, data types, and constraints. This ensures broad tool support and validation capabilities.  
* **Resource Description Framework (RDF):** SDC4's approach to embedding semantic meaning is fully compatible with RDF. The explicit labeling of model components, linked to universal business vocabularies, allows for easy transformation of SDC4 data into RDF triples, making it queryable via SPARQL and integrable into knowledge graphs.  
* **Web Ontology Language (OWL):** The semantic models underlying SDC4, particularly the universal business vocabulary and relationships between concepts, are expressible in OWL. This enables powerful reasoning, consistency checking, and automated semantic integration.  
* **SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL):** Because SDC4 data can be readily mapped to RDF, it becomes queryable using SPARQL, allowing for complex federated queries across diverse datasets that share an SDC4 foundation, regardless of their original domain-specific standard.

### **2.2. Enabling Industry-Specific Standards**

SDC4 acts as a "standard for standards," providing a meta-framework that complements and enhances existing industry data standards by addressing common challenges that often fall outside their primary scope of defining specific data elements. By adopting SDC4, organizations can bring a consistent approach to data governance, semantic clarity, and quality assurance *across* different standards they may use.  
Key areas where SDC4 enables and strengthens industry standards include:

* **Healthcare (e.g., HL7 FHIR):** While FHIR defines clinical data resources, SDC4 can standardize the governance and provenance metadata *around* FHIR resources, and provide a consistent mechanism for describing data quality issues (e.g., using ExceptionalValue types to explicitly tag why a FHIR element might be missing or invalid, rather than relying on implicit nulls).  
* **Financial Services (e.g., ISO 20022, ACORD):** ISO 20022 defines financial messages, and ACORD focuses on insurance. SDC4 can provide a common semantic layer that links elements from these standards to a unified enterprise business vocabulary. It also formalizes data quality rules and governance for the exchange of these messages.  
* **Privacy Regulations (e.g., PIPEDA, GDPR, CCPA):** SDC4's granular XdAnyType includes access control tags (act) and robust provenance. This allows for explicit, machine-readable declaration of data sensitivity, consent information, and data lineage directly within the data model, simplifying compliance with complex privacy regulations.  
* **Regulatory Reporting (e.g., SEC EDGAR, XBRL):** XBRL provides a language for tagging financial data. SDC4 can ensure the underlying factual data being tagged is semantically unambiguous and includes robust quality and governance metadata, improving the reliability and auditability of regulatory submissions.

By providing a consistent, machine-readable framework for governance, semantics, and quality across these diverse domains, SDC4 reduces integration friction, improves data trustworthiness, and allows for more sophisticated data analytics and AI applications across an enterprise's entire data landscape.

## 

## **3\. Conformance**

Conformance to the Semantic Data Charter is defined at two levels:

* **SDC Reference Model Conformance:** A data model conforms to the SDC Reference Model if its defining XML Schema is a valid xsd:restriction of the SDC Reference Model (sdc4.xsd). Data models **MUST NOT** use xsd:extension to add new elements or attributes to the SDC types. Conformance requires that both the data model schema itself is valid and that any data instance successfully validates against that restricted schema.  
* **SDC Principles Conformance:** An organization's data practices conform to the SDC principles if they adhere to the governance, meaning, and quality pillars outlined in this document.

## 

## **4\. Architecture**

The SDC architecture is composed of the following key components:

* **Reference Model (RM):** A set of core data types and structures that serve as the building blocks for all SDC-compliant data models. The RM is defined in sdc4.xsd and sdc4.ttl.  
* **Data Models (DMs):** Domain-specific models created by constraining the components of the Reference Model.  
* **Model Components (MCs):** The individual building blocks within a Data Model, derived from the RM components.  
* **Semantic Annotations:** Metadata embedded within the data models that provide context and meaning, linking the data to ontologies and controlled vocabularies.

### **4.1. Core Data Types**

The SDC Reference Model provides a rich set of extended data types (Xd\* types) that go beyond the standard XML Schema data types. These include:

* XdAnyType: The base type for all SDC extended data types.  
* XdStringType, XdTokenType: For textual data.  
* XdBooleanType: For boolean values.  
* XdCountType, XdQuantityType, XdFloatType, XdDoubleType: For numeric data.  
* XdTemporalType: For date and time information.  
* XdLinkType: For creating relationships between data models.  
* XdFileType: For embedding or referencing binary data.  
* ClusterType: For grouping related data elements.  
* XdAdapterType: For adapting any Xd\* type for use within a ClusterType.

### 

### **4.2. Governance and Provenance Components**

The SDC Reference Model includes a comprehensive set of components for capturing data governance, provenance, and audit information directly within the data model.

#### 

#### **4.2.1. Governance**

Governance components define the actors, roles, and responsibilities associated with the data.

* **PartyType**: Represents an actor involved with the data, which can be a person, organization, device, or software application.  
* **ParticipationType**: Describes the role of a PartyType in a specific activity related to the data.  
* **AttestationType**: Provides a formal mechanism for a party to attest to the data's content.  
* **AuditType**: Captures a detailed audit trail of every system and user that has interacted with the data.  
* **Access Control**: The model supports linking to external access control systems via the acs element and allows for fine-grained control via the act (Access Control Tag) element.

#### 

#### **4.2.2. Provenance**

Provenance components provide a complete history of the data's origin, creation, and modification.

* **Instance Metadata**: The root DMType contains key provenance fields: instance\_id, instance\_version, creation\_timestamp, subject, and provider.  
* **Temporal Validity**: Every data element (XdAnyType) contains optional timestamp fields to track its lifecycle: vtb (Valid Time Begin), vte (Valid Time End), tr (Time Recorded), and modified.

### 

### **4.3. The Data Model (DM) Wrapper and Semantic Grounding**

A critical distinction exists between the metadata for a *data instance* and the metadata for the *data model definition* itself. The SDC architecture addresses both.

#### 

#### **4.3.1. The DMType as an Instance Wrapper**

The DMType serves as the root element for every SDC data instance. Its primary role is to be a container for the data payload and the provenance and governance metadata of that *specific instance*. The elements within the DMType, such as instance\_id, creation\_timestamp, provider, and subject, describe the "who, what, when, and where" of the data payload itself, not the abstract model it conforms to.

#### 

#### **4.3.2. Semantic Grounding of the Data Model Definition**

The semantic meaning and descriptive metadata of the *data model definition* (i.e., the schema) are established separately. This is where semantic vocabularies like Dublin Core are properly applied. This definition-level metadata is typically embedded directly within the schema files (e.g., using xsd:appinfo and RDF annotations in the XSD) or maintained in an external metadata registry.

### 

### **4.4. Model Component Reusability and Immutability**

A cornerstone of the SDC architecture is the ability to create reusable and immutable Model Components (MCs). This is achieved through a specific pattern of schema definition.  
When a domain-specific structure is needed, it is defined by creating a new xsd:complexType that restricts a base type from the SDC Reference Model (e.g., sdc4:ClusterType). This new complexType is given a unique and permanent name using a Collision-Resistant Unique Identifier (CUID2), prefixed with mc-, such as mc-clj5x1g8f000008l09j7f6c3d.  
To incorporate this component into a Data Model, an xsd:element is declared with a corresponding ms- prefixed name, assigned the mc-\<CUID2\> type, and placed into the xsd:substitutionGroup of a generic element from the Reference Model (e.g., sdc4:Item).  
This mechanism provides three key advantages:

1. **Immutability and Reuse**: The mc-\<CUID2\> component can be imported and reused across multiple Data Models.  
2. **Consistent Querying**: An application can reliably query for all instances of the ms-clj5x1g8f000008l09j7f6c3d element, knowing it will always find the same structure.  
3. **Separation of Structure and Semantics**: This pattern decouples the immutable physical structure from its semantic meaning. The mc-\<CUID2\> and ms-\<CUID2\> define the structure, while the label element within that component's schema definition is *fixed* to provide the specific, immutable business context (e.g., fixed="Systolic").

### 

### **4.5. Data Longevity and Migration Avoidance**

A significant challenge in traditional data management is the need for costly, complex, and error-prone data migrations when underlying schemas evolve or applications are replaced. The SDC4 architecture is designed to address this issue at its core and promote data longevity.  
The combination of:

1. **A Stable Reference Model:** Providing a consistent set of base types and structural patterns.  
2. **Immutable Structural Components:** Using CUIDs (mc-\<cuid\> and ms-\<cuid\>) to define reusable data structures whose physical shape is guaranteed not to change.  
3. **Explicit, Decoupled Semantics:** Embedding the meaning via fixed label elements and optional RDF annotations, rather than relying on structural element names.

means that data created according to an SDC4 Data Model remains inherently understandable and processable over time.  
New applications or future versions of existing applications can interpret historical SDC4 data because:

* The **structure** associated with a given ms-\<cuid\> is permanently defined by its corresponding mc-\<cuid\> restriction in the schema.  
* The **meaning** of that structure is explicitly stated by the fixed label (and potentially richer RDF annotations) within that schema definition.

Unlike traditional approaches, which often break backward compatibility and require data transformation when element names or nesting structures change, SDC4 isolates structural definition from semantic interpretation. As long as the SDC Reference Model remains stable and the CUIDs persist, the data remains usable. This significantly reduces or potentially eliminates the need for large-scale data migrations, lowering long-term data management costs and preserving the value of historical data assets.

##

## **5\. Modeling Examples**

***Note:*** *The following XML snippets are instance documents. They are based on data model schemas where CUID-named elements (ms-... and dm-...) define the data structure. The semantic meaning, such as "Blood Pressure" or "Systolic", is not present in the instance-label element; instead, it is a fixed attribute in the schema definition of the corresponding component, as described in Section 4.4.*

## **6\. Security Considerations**

Implementers of the Semantic Data Charter should be aware of the following security considerations:

* **Data Privacy:** When modeling data that contains personally identifiable information (PII), care must be taken to ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
* **Access Control:** The act (Access Control Tag) element in XdAnyType should be used to enforce access control policies.
* **Data Integrity:** The hash-result and hash-function elements in XdFileType can be used to verify the integrity of binary data.

## **Appendix A: Xd* Type Reference and Standard Datatype Mappings**

This appendix provides a comprehensive reference for all SDC4 extended data types (Xd* types), their corresponding Type classes, mappings to standard database and programming language datatypes, available constraints, and usage guidance.

### **A.1. Overview**

SDC4 provides semantically rich extended data types that enhance basic data values with governance, provenance, and constraint information. Each Xd* type consists of:

- **Value Component**: The actual data value (e.g., `xdstring-value`, `xdcount-value`)
- **Type Class**: The corresponding complexType definition (e.g., `XdStringType`, `XdCountType`)
- **Constraint Capabilities**: Available validation rules specific to the type
- **Metadata Support**: Inherited from `XdAnyType` (label, definition, temporal validity, access control)

### **A.2. Textual Data Types**

#### **A.2.1. XdString / XdStringType**

**Purpose**: General-purpose character string data with rich constraint support.

**Standard Datatype Mappings**:
- SQL: `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, `CHAR`, `NVARCHAR`, `CLOB`
- JSON/JavaScript: `string`
- Python: `str`
- Java: `String`
- C#: `string`

**Available Constraints**:
- `min_length`: Minimum string length (integer)
- `max_length`: Maximum string length (integer)
- `exact_length`: Fixed string length (integer)
- `regex_pattern`: Regular expression pattern for validation
- `enumeration`: List of allowed values (controlled vocabulary)

**Use Cases**:
- Free-text fields (names, addresses, descriptions)
- Formatted strings (email, phone, postal codes) using regex patterns
- Controlled vocabularies using enumeration constraints
- Customer IDs, order numbers, SKUs

**Example Schema Definition**:
```xml
<xsd:complexType name="mc-email-address">
  <xsd:complexContent>
    <xsd:restriction base="sdc4:XdStringType">
      <xsd:sequence>
        <xsd:element name="label" type="xsd:string" fixed="Email Address"/>
        <xsd:element name="xdstring-value">
          <xsd:simpleType>
            <xsd:restriction base="xsd:string">
              <xsd:pattern value="[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}"/>
            </xsd:restriction>
          </xsd:simpleType>
        </xsd:element>
      </xsd:sequence>
    </xsd:restriction>
  </xsd:complexContent>
</xsd:complexType>
```

**When to Use**: Any textual data that doesn't require numeric calculations.

---

#### **A.2.2. XdToken / XdTokenType**

**Purpose**: Normalized whitespace string for machine-readable identifiers and codes.

**Standard Datatype Mappings**:
- SQL: `VARCHAR` (with normalized whitespace)
- JSON/JavaScript: `string`
- Python: `str`
- XML Schema: `xsd:token` (collapses whitespace, trims leading/trailing)

**Available Constraints**:
- Same as XdString (length constraints, patterns, enumeration)
- Automatic whitespace normalization

**Use Cases**:
- Machine-readable codes (ISO codes, medical codes, product codes)
- Standardized identifiers where whitespace variations should be ignored
- API tokens, authentication codes

**When to Use**: Choose XdToken over XdString when whitespace normalization is desired (e.g., codes that should ignore extra spaces).

---

### **A.3. Boolean Data Types**

#### **A.3.1. XdBoolean / XdBooleanType**

**Purpose**: True/false logical values with semantic labeling.

**Standard Datatype Mappings**:
- SQL: `BOOLEAN`, `BIT`, `TINYINT(1)`
- JSON/JavaScript: `boolean`
- Python: `bool`
- Java: `Boolean`, `boolean`
- C#: `bool`, `Boolean`

**Available Constraints**:
- Default value specification
- Required/optional flags

**Use Cases**:

- Status indicators (active/inactive, enabled/disabled)

**Example Instance**:
```xml
<sdc4:ms-consent-given>
  <sdc4:label>Patient Consent Given</sdc4:label>
  <sdc4:xdboolean-value>true</sdc4:xdboolean-value>
</sdc4:ms-consent-given>
```

**When to Use**: Binary states, logical conditions, yes/no decisions.

---

### **A.4. Numeric Data Types**

SDC4 distinguishes between **quantified** (with units) and **non-quantified** (unitless) numeric types.

#### **A.4.1. XdCount / XdCountType**

**Purpose**: Non-negative integer counts with optional units.

  <sdc4:xdcount-value>100</sdc4:xdcount-value>
  <sdc4:xdcount-units>
    <sdc4:xdstring-value>shares</sdc4:xdstring-value>
  </sdc4:xdcount-units>
</sdc4:ms-share-quantity>
```

**When to Use**: Non-negative integers representing counts or quantities. Unlike XdQuantity, XdCount values are always whole numbers.

---

  <sdc4:xdquantity-units>
    <sdc4:xdstring-value>mmHg</sdc4:xdstring-value>
  </sdc4:xdquantity-units>
</sdc4:ms-systolic-bp>
```

**When to Use**: Any numeric value that represents a physical quantity and requires units. This is the most common quantified numeric type.

---

### **A.5. Temporal Data Types**

#### **A.5.1. XdTemporal / XdTemporalType**

**Purpose**: Flexible temporal data supporting various granularities (date, time, datetime, partial dates).

**Standard Datatype Mappings**:
- SQL: `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`
- JSON/JavaScript: `string` (ISO 8601 format)

</sdc4:ms-measurement-time>
```

**When to Use**: Any temporal data. XdTemporal's flexibility allows it to represent full timestamps, dates only, times only, or partial dates depending on data requirements.

---

### **A.6. Enumerated and Ordinal Data Types**

#### **A.6.1. XdOrdinal / XdOrdinalType**

**Purpose**: Ordered categorical values with semantic labels and numeric codes.

**Standard Datatype Mappings**:
- SQL: `SMALLINT` or `VARCHAR` with lookup table

  <sdc4:xdordinal-symbol>
    <sdc4:xdstring-value>Moderate</sdc4:xdstring-value>
  </sdc4:xdordinal-symbol>
</sdc4:ms-pain-level>
```

**When to Use**: Use XdOrdinal when categories have a meaningful order. For unordered categories (e.g., colors, countries), use XdString with enumeration constraint.

---

### **A.7. Reference and Link Types**

#### **A.7.1. XdLink / XdLinkType**

**Purpose**: References to other data models, external resources, or relationships.

**Standard Datatype Mappings**:

  <sdc4:xdlink-relationship>subject_of</sdc4:xdlink-relationship>
</sdc4:ms-patient-reference>
```

**When to Use**: Any reference to another entity, document, or resource. XdLink provides semantic relationship information beyond simple foreign keys.

---

### **A.8. Binary Data Types**

#### **A.8.1. XdFile / XdFileType**

**Purpose**: Binary data or file references with metadata and integrity checking.

**Standard Datatype Mappings**:
- SQL: `BLOB`, `BYTEA`, `VARBINARY`, `VARCHAR` (for file paths)
- JSON/JavaScript: Base64 encoded string, file path
- Python: `bytes`, file path string
- Java: `byte[]`, `File`, `Path`

**Available Constraints**:

  <sdc4:xdfile-hash-result>a3f5b...</sdc4:xdfile-hash-result>
</sdc4:ms-patient-photo>
```

**When to Use**: Binary data storage or file references. XdFile supports both embedded base64-encoded data and external file references with integrity verification.

---

### **A.9. Interval and Range Types**

#### **A.9.1. XdInterval / XdIntervalType**

**Purpose**: Ranges or intervals with upper and lower bounds.

**Standard Datatype Mappings**:
- SQL: Two columns (lower_bound, upper_bound), or `RANGE` types (PostgreSQL)

- Acceptable value ranges for validation
- Quantity ranges (price ranges, measurement ranges)

**Example (XdQuantityInterval)**:
```xml
<sdc4:ms-normal-systolic-range>
  <sdc4:label>Normal Systolic BP Range</sdc4:label>
  <sdc4:xdquantity-interval-lower>90</sdc4:xdquantity-interval-lower>
  <sdc4:xdquantity-interval-upper>120</sdc4:xdquantity-interval-upper>
  <sdc4:xdquantity-units>
    <sdc4:xdstring-value>mmHg</sdc4:xdstring-value>
  </sdc4:xdquantity-units>
</sdc4:ms-normal-systolic-range>
```

**When to Use**: Any data representing a range of values. XdInterval types provide semantic meaning for lower/upper bounds and can express inclusive/exclusive boundaries.

---

### **A.10. Type Selection Decision Tree**

Use this decision tree to select the appropriate Xd* type:

**1. Is the data textual?**
- **Yes**: XdString (or XdToken for normalized codes)

**2. Is the data boolean (true/false)?**

### **A.12. Common Datatype Mapping Examples**

#### **CSV/Spreadsheet to Xd* Types**

| **CSV Data** | **Example Value** | **Xd* Type** | **Reasoning** |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Name, Address, Description | "John Doe" | XdString | Free-text character data |
| Country Code, Product SKU | "US", "SKU-12345" | XdString (with enumeration or pattern) | Controlled codes |
| Enabled, Active, Consented | "true", "yes", "1" | XdBoolean | Boolean logic |
| Quantity, Count, Number of Items | 42, 1000 | XdCount | Non-negative integers |
| Price, Weight, Temperature | 19.99, 72.5 | XdQuantity | Decimal with units |
| Date, DateTime, Timestamp | "2025-11-09", "2025-11-09T15:30:00Z" | XdTemporal | Temporal data |
| Priority, Severity, Rating | "High", "Severe" | XdOrdinal | Ordered categories |
| Email, URL, Reference ID | "user@example.com" | XdString (with regex pattern) | Formatted strings |

#### **Database Column to Xd* Types**

| **SQL Type** | **Xd* Type** | **Notes** |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| VARCHAR, CHAR, TEXT | XdString | General text |

| DECIMAL, NUMERIC | XdQuantity | Quantities with units |
| REAL, FLOAT(24) | XdFloat | Single-precision floating-point |
| DOUBLE PRECISION, FLOAT(53) | XdDouble | Double-precision floating-point |
| DATE, TIMESTAMP | XdTemporal | Temporal data |
| ENUM (ordered) | XdOrdinal | Ordered enumerations |
| BLOB, BYTEA | XdFile | Binary data |
| Foreign Key, URI column | XdLink | References to other entities |

---

### **A.13. Best Practices**

1. **Always Use Units for Quantified Types**: XdCount and XdQuantity require units. Even if units seem obvious (e.g., "items"), specify them explicitly.

2. **Choose Appropriate Numeric Types**:
   - Use **XdCount** for non-negative integer counts
   - Use **XdQuantity** for decimal measurements with units
   - Use **XdFloat/XdDouble** only for scientific calculations where floating-point representation is required
   - Avoid XdFloat/XdDouble for financial data (use XdQuantity with DECIMAL instead)

3. **Leverage Constraints**: Define constraints in the schema (regex patterns, min/max values, enumerations) to ensure data quality.

4. **Use XdOrdinal for Ordered Categories**: If categories have meaningful order (severity, priority), use XdOrdinal instead of XdString.

5. **Embed Semantics in Labels**: Use the fixed `label` element in schema definitions to provide immutable semantic meaning.

6. **Temporal Granularity**: XdTemporal supports various granularities. Choose the appropriate level (date only, datetime, etc.) based on requirements.

7. **File Integrity**: When using XdFile, always include hash values for integrity verification, especially for medical or financial documents.

8. **Link Relationships**: When using XdLink, specify the relationship semantics (e.g., "subject_of", "part_of", "derived_from") for clarity.

### **A.14. Xd* Type Inheritance Hierarchy**

```
XdAnyType (base type - provides label, definition, temporal metadata, access control)
├── XdStringType
├── XdTokenType
├── XdBooleanType
├── XdOrderedType (abstract - provides ordering semantics)
│   ├── XdOrdinalType
│   └── XdQuantifiedType (abstract - provides units, magnitude status)
│       ├── XdCountType
│       ├── XdQuantityType
│       ├── XdFloatType
│       └── XdDoubleType
├── XdTemporalType
├── XdLinkType
├── XdFileType
└── XdIntervalType (abstract)
    ├── XdCountIntervalType
    ├── XdQuantityIntervalType
    └── XdTemporalIntervalType
```

**Key Points**:
- All types inherit governance and provenance metadata from `XdAnyType`
- **Quantified types** (XdCount, XdQuantity, XdFloat, XdDouble) inherit from `XdQuantifiedType` and require units
- **Interval types** provide range semantics for their corresponding base types

## **7\. Reference Model Component Details**

This section provides a detailed explanation of the primary complexType components available in the SDC Reference Model (sdc4.xsd).

### 

### **7.1. Root and Structural Components**

These components form the foundational structure of any SDC Data Model.

* **DMType**: The mandatory root element type for any SDC instance document. It acts as a wrapper for the data payload and contains instance-specific metadata.  
  **Data Model Schema Example:** This example defines the root element for a "Patient Vitals" Data Model. It restricts the base DMType, fixes the dm-label to provide the model's semantic name, and specifies that the main data payload will be a specific "Vitals Cluster" component.  
  \<xsd:complexType name="mc-h7k2x..."\>  
    \<xsd:complexContent\>  
      \<xsd:restriction base="sdc4:DMType"\>  
        \<xsd:sequence\>  
          \<xsd:element name="dm-label" type="xsd:string" fixed="Patient Vitals"/\>  
          \<xsd:element name="dm-language" type="xsd:language" fixed="en-US"/\>  
          \<xsd:element name="dm-encoding" type="xsd:string" fixed="UTF-8"/\>  
          ...  
          \<\!-- The root item for this DM is a specific cluster \--\>  
          \<xsd:element ref="sdc4:ms-clj5x1g8f000008l09j7f6c3d"/\>  
          ...  
        \</xsd:sequence\>  
      \</xsd:restriction\>  
    \</xsd:complexContent\>  
  \</xsd:complexType\>

* **ItemType**: An abstract type that serves as the base for ClusterType and XdAdapterType. It is not used directly but enables polymorphism in the model.  
* **ClusterType**: A container component used to group other ItemType elements (either other clusters or adapters). This allows for the creation of arbitrarily complex hierarchical data structures.  
  **Data Model Schema Example:** This defines a reusable "Blood Pressure" cluster. It contains references to two adapted quantity components, one for systolic and one for diastolic pressure. The label is fixed, making the semantics of this structure immutable.

* **XdAdapterType**: A "leaf" node in a ClusterType structure. It acts as a wrapper that holds a single data-typed component (XdAnyType), adapting it for inclusion in a cluster's item list.  
  **Data Model Schema Example:** This defines an adapter for the "Systolic" component. It restricts XdAdapterType and specifies that it must contain exactly one ms-... element that represents the systolic blood pressure value.

### **7.2. Core Data Types (Xd\* Types)**

These types provide semantically rich representations for common data values.

* **XdStringType**: A general-purpose type for character strings.  
  **Data Model Schema Example:** This creates a reusable component for a "Customer ID". It restricts XdStringType, fixes the label, and applies a regex pattern to the value, enforcing a specific format.  
  \<xsd:complexType name="mc-clj5x4b1c000308l0i9j8k7l6"\>  
    \<xsd:complexContent\>  
      \<xsd:restriction base="sdc4:XdStringType"\>  
        \<xsd:sequence\>  
          \<xsd:element name="label" type="xsd:string" fixed="Customer ID"/\>  
          ...  
          \<xsd:element name="xdstring-value"\>  
            \<xsd:simpleType\>  
              \<xsd:restriction base="xsd:string"\>  
                \<xsd:pattern value="CUST-\[0-9\]{5}"/\>  
              \</xsd:restriction\>  
            \</xsd:simpleType\>  
          \</xsd:element\>  
          ...  
        \</xsd:sequence\>  
      \</xsd:restriction\>  
    \</xsd:complexContent\>  
  \</xsd:complexType\>

* **XdQuantityType**: Represents a physical quantity with a decimal value and units.  
  **Data Model Schema Example:** This defines a "Systolic Blood Pressure" component. It restricts XdQuantityType, fixes the label, and requires the units to be "mmHg".  
  \<xsd:complexType name="mc-clj5x2p4k000108l01a2b3c4d"\>  
    \<xsd:complexContent\>  
      \<xsd:restriction base="sdc4:XdQuantityType"\>  
        \<xsd:sequence\>  
          \<xsd:element name="label" type="xsd:string" fixed="Systolic"/\>  
          ...  
          \<xsd:element name="xdquantity-value" type="xsd:decimal"/\>  
          \<xsd:element name="xdquantity-units"\>  
            \<xsd:complexType\>  
              \<xsd:complexContent\>  
                \<xsd:restriction base="sdc4:XdStringType"\>  
                  \<xsd:sequence\>  
                    \<xsd:element name="xdstring-value" type="xsd:string" fixed="mmHg"/\>  
                  \</xsd:sequence\>  
                \</xsd:restriction\>  
              \</xsd:complexContent\>  
            \</xsd:complexType\>  
          \</xsd:element\>  
        \</xsd:sequence\>  
      \</xsd:restriction\>  
    \</xsd:complexContent\>  
  \</xsd:complexType\>

* **XdTemporalType**: A flexible type for representing date and time.  
  **Data Model Schema Example:** This defines a "Measurement Time" component. It restricts XdTemporalType to allow *only* an xsd:dateTime value, ensuring full temporal precision.  
  \<xsd:complexType name="mc-clj5x3a9b000208l0e5f6g7h8"\>  
    \<xsd:complexContent\>  
      \<xsd:restriction base="sdc4:XdTemporalType"\>  
        \<xsd:sequence\>  
          \<xsd:element name="label" type="xsd:string" fixed="Measurement Time"/\>  
          ...  
          \<xsd:choice\>  
            \<xsd:element name="xdtemporal-datetime" type="xsd:dateTime"/\>  
          \</xsd:choice\>  
        \</xsd:sequence\>  
      \</xsd:restriction\>  
    \</xsd:complexContent\>  
  \</xsd:complexType\>
