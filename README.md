# Semantic Data Charter Reference Model (SDCRM)

This repository contains the reference model implementations and specifications for the Semantic Data Charter (SDC). The SDC is a framework for creating interoperable and reusable data models.

## SDC4 Reference Model

The `sdc4` directory contains the core components of the SDC release 4.0.0. These components are provided in two formats:

*   **Web Ontology Language (OWL):** The `.owl` files provide the semantic definition of the SDC reference model.
    *   `sdc4.owl`: Defines the main classes and properties of the SDC4 reference model.
    *   `sdc4-meta.owl`: Defines the meta-level concepts and relationships, mapping XML Schema structures to conceptual entities.
*   **XML Schema Definition (XSD):** The `sdc4.xsd` file provides the XML schema for validating SDC-compliant data models.

These files are the foundation for building SDC-compliant data models and ensuring their interoperability.
